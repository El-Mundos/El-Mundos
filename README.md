I provide high-performance technical solutions by bridging the gap between sophisticated software development and rock-solid system infrastructure. Whether it's compiling a custom Linux Kernel or building a Next.js frontend, I focus on **efficiency, security, and the "metal" underneath.**

🚀 **The Stack:**
* **Systems & Low-Level:** Linux (LFS, Arch), Rust (Contributor to @spotatui), C/C++, Bash.
* **Data & Backend:** Python (FastAPI/Django), SQL (PostgreSQL), Azure Cloud & Databricks (Architecture Focus).
* **Web & Full-Stack:** Next.js, React, TypeScript.
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, Wireguard, Enterprise Hardware (Xeon/SAS).

## 🏠 The Homelab (My Production Environment)
*I don't just deploy to the cloud; I host on the metal.*

* **Hardware:** Running on **Enterprise Intel Xeon & RDIMM RAM**.
* **Networking:** Wireguard VPN tunnels for secure remote access.
* **Services:** * **VideoVisionary:** Custom web hosting and streaming architecture.
    * **Mail & Privacy:** Self-hosted disposable email tools and media servers.
* **Security:** Hardened with Fail2Ban, UFW, and strict network segmentation.
